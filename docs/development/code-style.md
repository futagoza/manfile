I currently use a mixture of [coding conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) in my projects, but have gotton into the habit of using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to confirm my style is consistant, while readable, across all my JavaScript based projects, and that I only use [valid Node.js features](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node). I even have my own eslint configuration you can extend from :D
